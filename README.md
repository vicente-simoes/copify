# Copify

Copify is a local Windows desktop console for isolated persistent Chrome sessions.

## v0.2

- Direct/home networking is the default; proxies are optional per browser profile.
- HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxy profiles support encrypted optional credentials.
- Test the direct route or a proxy to record public IP, location, latency, jitter, failures, stability, and a 0–100 quality score.
- Proxy credentials are only decrypted in Electron main immediately before runner launch and are never displayed or written to logs.

The default route probe is `https://ipwho.is/`. It can be replaced with an HTTPS endpoint returning compatible IP/geolocation JSON.
